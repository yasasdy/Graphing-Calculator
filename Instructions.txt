Instructions :
        It works like a normal graphic calculator, hence the basic rules apply
1.) Please do not enter both the variables (x, y) in the same equation

2.) If f(x) is the given function, then the equation is assumed to y=f(x) even
though "y=" is not given and vice versa if 'y' is the variable.

3.) This is only a graph plotter and not an equation solver. Hence it is advised
not to enter '=' if a variable is inputted

4.) If the given equation doesnt contain any variable, please choose whether
the graph (if wanted to be drawn) should be drawn parallel to 'x' or 'y' axis

5.) The program is written for only integer/integer division. Hence 3/2 will
return 1

6.) Once the graph is plotted, press 1 to increase the scale and 0 to decrease
